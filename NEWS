5.2					March 20, 2008

	* Core changes:
		* GConf default values were no longer registered:
		  fixed
		* The GConf sanity check code (which caused MN to
		  refuse to run if some GConf default values are
		  missing) was no longer compiled in: fixed

5.1					March 20, 2008

	* Core changes:
		* The message count of the status icon was sometimes
		  not properly redrawn: fixed (#185999)
		* Time settings are now entered using sliders; these
		  sliders are non-linear and allow to easily choose an
		  appropriate value without having to use the keyboard
		* The "mailbox name" and "delay between mail checks"
		  mailbox settings have been moved to a separate tab,
		  and are no longer modified as a side effect of
		  modifying other settings (it could be confusing)
		* The cancel button of the mailbox properties dialog
		  now works in a standard way: if the apply button was
		  used, these changes are undone
		* The number of messages of the tooltip mail summary
		  is now limited, via the
		  /apps/mail-notification/popups/limit GConf key
		  (#184487)
		* The transparency issue of the tooltip mail summary
		  (https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?19104) was still
		  present: fixed
		* The interprocess communication code now uses D-Bus
		  rather than Bonobo. This move was made because
		  Bonobo suffers from a number of bugs and
		  limitations, and is deprecated.
		* libeel is no longer used since its API is not stable
		  (#180400)
		* The build system has been changed from the GNU
		  Autotools to JB (the Jean-Yves Lefort's Build
		  System)

	* IMAP, Maildir, mbox, MH, Mozilla, POP3, Sylpheed, Windows
	  Live Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail changes:

		* The GConf setting
		  /apps/mail-notification/fallback-charsets has been
		  added. This setting is used when attempting to
		  convert invalidly encoded message headers to
		  UTF-8. Previously, the hardcoded fallback encoding
		  was ISO8859-1, but changes in GMime 2.2.7 broke the
		  fallback code.

	* IMAP, Maildir and POP3 changes:
		* Bandwidth usage has been reduced (message headers
		  are now cached)

	* IMAP and POP3 changes:
		* SSL/TLS error messages are now more detailed

	* Sylpheed and Maildir changes:
		* Message popup actions are now executed in a separate
		  thread, to avoid blocking the user interface

	* Maildir changes:
		* The "delete message" dialog (which is displayed when
		  a message cannot be moved to the trash) could
		  disappear if the mailbox changed: fixed

	* MH changes:
		* xmh mailboxes containing no new mail are now
		  properly detected as MH mailboxes (#196929, patch by
		  Peter Kjellerstedt)

	* Windows Live Hotmail changes:

		* Account languages other than English are now
		  supported. Support was added for Brazilian
		  Portuguese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German,
		  Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish,
		  Swedish (#185993).
		* Folder names containing non-ASCII characters are now
		  handled properly

	* Yahoo! Mail changes:
		* Folder names containing ISO8859-1 characters in the
		  range 128-255 are now handled properly

	* Evolution changes:
		* When Evolution is not running, it is now monitored
		  passively rather than checked every second. This
		  change was made possible by the switch from Bonobo
		  to D-Bus.
		* The "delay between mail checks" option is no longer
		  used (previously, it was only used when the
		  Evolution folder was not found, but not even that is
		  necessary)

	* Updated translations:
		* French
		* Serbian (Filip Miletic)
		* Spanish (Nacho Hermoso de Mendoza)
		* Swedish (Daniel Nylander)

5.0					January 4, 2008

	* Core changes:
		* The tooltip mail summary now respects the GTK+ theme
		  colors (#177067)
		* The "Sent:" fields of the tooltip are now updated
		  only once per second, when the second changes
		  (previously, they were updated twice per second at
		  no precise point in time, so they could lag behind
		  the clock for as much as half a second)

	* IMAP and POP3 changes:
		* The build no longer fails when SSL/TLS is disabled

	* Updated translations:
		* Serbian (Filip Miletic)
		* Swedish (Daniel Nylander)

	* New translations:
		* Spanish (Nacho Hermoso de Mendoza)

5.0 Release Candidate 1			November 27, 2007

	* Core changes:
		* A "Play a sound when new mail arrives" option has
		  been added
		* Yahoo! Mail support has been added (requires
		  fetchyahoo)
		* Windows Live Hotmail support has been added
		  (requires GetLive)
		* A "consider new mail as read" action has been added
		  (#18241)
		* An optional message count has been added over the
		  icon (#18241)
		* The "Display the properties dialog" click action was
		  not very useful and has been removed
		* The size of the status icon is now dynamically
		  adjusted when the size of the notification area
		  changes
		* The mailbox list icon selection algorithm has been
		  made more coherent; the "timer" icon was confusing
		  and has been removed
		* In order to simplify the properties dialog, several
		  options have been removed (they are however still
		  available in GConf)
		* The "Delay between mail checks" spin buttons did not
		  retain a value typed in manually: fixed (#19379)
		* If a mailbox was added or removed while the "Test
		  messages" option was enabled, a bogus mailbox was
		  added to the configuration file: fixed
		* If some GConf default values are missing, MN will
		  now refuse to run. This ensures that MN will not
		  behave unexpectedly because of unproper
		  installation.
		* The simultaneous number of popups is now limited
		  (/apps/mail-notification/popups/limit)
		* New messages are no longer cleared when a mailbox
		  error occurs. This way, already shown message popups
		  will not unduly reappear after the error is unset
		  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mail-notification/+bug/78487).
		* Message popups are now closed when MN exits
		* Minor bugs have been fixed (#20266, #20352, #20353)
		* Mail Notification is now licensed under the terms of
		  the GNU General Public License version 3
		* The documentation is now licensed under the terms of
		  the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.2

	* Gmail, IMAP and POP3 changes:
		* Passwords are now encrypted, using GNOME
		  Keyring. Note that I do not endorse the flawed GNOME
		  Keyring approach of granting passwords an
		  encryption-worth status while ignoring other
		  sensitive data. Furthermore, at the time of this
		  writing, GNOME Keyring does not seem to prevent the
		  memory it uses for storing the passwords from being
		  swapped out to disk. However, despite these flaws,
		  it has been observed that GNOME Keyring has
		  beneficial psychological effects on some users. For
		  increased psychological well-being, MN even moves
		  the plain text passwords it finds in mailboxes.xml
		  to the keyring.
		* Filling in the username in the mailbox properties is
		  now mandatory again (it had been optional since 2.0)

	* IMAP and POP3 changes:
		* The "Connect to untrusted server?" dialog is now
		  closed when the mailbox is removed

	* Gmail changes:
		* Label support has been added

	* IMAP changes:
		* IMAP URLs (RFC 2192) having no path component are
		  now handled properly again

	* POP3 changes:
		* The RSA MD5 implementation has been replaced by the
		  glibc implementation because the RSA license is
		  incompatible with the GPL (#21138)

	* Maildir changes:
		* The delete message action has been implemented

	* MH changes:
		* Race conditions with the MDA and MUA are now
		  avoided, using a delay-based workaround

	* Evolution changes:
		* The Evolution 2.12 API change which caused the build
		  to fail has been adapted to; as a consequence, MN
		  now requires Evolution 2.12 or superior (#20904)
		* The configure script now properly uses the
		  unversioned evolution-plugin package which was
		  introduced with Evolution 2.10 (#20904, #20124)

	* Sylpheed changes:
		* The delay-based race condition avoidance code now
		  works regardless of the underlying file monitor
		  implementation
		* Claws Mail mailboxes (which contain both a
		  .mh_sequences and a .sylpheed_mark file) are now
		  detected as Sylpheed mailboxes rather than as MH
		  mailboxes: this removes the need to use rcvstore
		  from procmail
		* The --enable-sylpheed-locking configure option has
		  been removed: the appropriate race condition
		  avoidance strategy is now automatically detected at
		  runtime

	* Updated translations:
		* French
		* Polish (Tomasz Sałaciński)

4.1					June 26, 2007

	* Core changes:
		* The at-spi breakage which caused MN to hang at
		  startup has been worked around (#19189)
		* The order and presence of the message popup actions
		  is now configurable via the
		  /apps/mail-notification/popups/actions GConf key
		* A delete message action has been added (#19696,
		  based on a patch by David Woodhouse)
		* Command line options are now parsed with the GOption
		  framework
		* The tooltip mail summary is now truly transparent
		  (#19104)
		* The src/automake.xml file is now distributed
		* The documentation is now licensed under the terms of
		  the GNU Free Documentation License

	* mbox, MH, Maildir, POP3, IMAP, Mozilla and Sylpheed changes:
		* Messages marked as spam (by SpamAssassin or
		  bogofilter) are now ignored

	* MH, Maildir and Sylpheed changes:
		* Mailbox type change events are now properly handled
		  on all systems, regardless of the underlying file
		  monitor implementation

	* POP3 and IMAP changes:
		* If SSL/TLS support is not compiled in but a mailbox
		  is configured to use SSL/TLS, MN now refuses to
		  login (#20131)
		* OpenSSL is now instructed to lookup CA certificates
		  from default locations (#19578)
		* The SSL/TLS certificate verification code now checks
		  if the user-provided server name matches one of the
		  certificate-provided server names (RFC 3501 11.1)
		* OpenSSL locking is now enabled, and the configure
		  script now ensures that OpenSSL supports
		  multi-threading (#19643)

	* POP3 changes:
		* An interoperability issue has been fixed (#19934)

	* IMAP changes:
		* Two interoperability issues have been fixed (#18865,
		  #20132)
		* Uncompliant servers which do not send an untagged
		  SEARCH response are now tolerated (#18876)

	* Evolution changes:
		* The 2.11/2.12 branch is now supported, and the
		  mail-notification plugin has been renamed so that it
		  does not conflict with the new Evolution plugin of
		  the same name (#20124)

	* Updated translations:
		* French
		* Czech (Pav Lucistnik)
		* Dutch (Marcel J. Zwiebel)
		* Swedish (Daniel Nylander)
		* Serbian (Filip Miletic)

4.0					January 17, 2007

	No major changes.

4.0 Release Candidate 2			December 7, 2006

	* Evolution changes:
		* An infinite loop has been fixed (see
		  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=208774,
		  thanks to David Woodhouse for his help)

	* Updated translations:
		* Serbian (Filip Miletic)
		* Czech (Pav Lucistnik)
		* Dutch (Marcel J. Zwiebel)
		* Brazilian Portuguese (Claudio André)

4.0 Release Candidate 1			November 27, 2006

	* Core changes:
		* The mail summary popup has been replaced by
		  libnotify message popups. These new message popups
		  also provide actions such as "Open" and "Mark as Spam"
		* Mozilla products (Mozilla, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, ...)
		  mailboxes are now supported
		* The mailbox properties dialog has been redesigned
		* A new click action has been added: open the latest
		  message
		* A MN icon set has been designed by Josef Vybíral
		  (#18198)
		* A --print-summary command line argument has been
		  added, allowing to access message data from an
		  external program
		* A mail-changed GConf command setting has been added
		  (it is executed when new mail is received or when a
		  message is read)
		* Handling of the GNOME mail reader command: instead
		  of stripping %s, the first word of the command is
		  now used; moreover, mozilla and evolution are now
		  handled specially (#18257)
		* The /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/mailto/needs_terminal
		  GConf key is now respected
		* Could no longer close the about dialog with recent
		  GTK+ versions: fixed (#18252)

	* POP3 changes:
		* Messages kept on the server but marked as read are
		  now discarded. Note that this only works with
		  servers which send Status headers; most don't
		  (#18164).

	* Evolution changes:
		* All mailboxes now share the same CORBA connection to
		  Evolution (reduces resource usage)
		* A mailbox properties dialog crash has been fixed
		  (#18228)
		* Some memory leaks have been fixed
		* Support for the Evolution 2.9/2.10 branch has been
		  added
		* The Evolution 2.2 branch is no longer supported

		* Evolution crashed when a message without Subject or
		  From header was received: fixed
		* Mail Notification could crash when removing an
		  Evolution mailbox: fixed

	* Updated translations:

		* Czech (Pav Lucistnik)
		* Dutch (Marcel J. Zwiebel)

	* New translations:
		* Swedish (Daniel Nylander)

3.0 Release Candidate 1			May 16, 2006

	* Core changes:
		* An alternate, compact mail summary has been added
		* A "Display seen messages" option has been added
		* The status icon can now be displayed permanently
		* The "Delay between mail checks" option is now
		  mailbox-specific
		* The properties dialog has been reorganized
		* The main window has been removed
		* The status icon is now activated with a single click
		  (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148829)
		* The GTK+ bugs
		  (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321886)
		  which caused occasional crashes have been worked
		  around
		* If the MAIL environment variable is not defined or
		  invalid, the system mailbox is now looked up in
		  /var/spool/mail/username and /var/mail/username
		  (based on a patch from Benoît Rouits)
		* Since ~/.gnome2/mail-notification/mailboxes.xml may
		  contain sensitive information, it is now saved with
		  permissions set to 0600 (useful for systems where
		  home directories have lax permissions)
		* The "cannot enable immediate notification" error
		  dialog has been removed
		* The --list-features command line option has been
		  removed (feature information is now displayed in the
		  output of the --version option)
		* The message handling performance has been improved
		* If there are no mailboxes on startup, the properties
		  dialog is now displayed
		* The "Start Mail Notification on GNOME login" option
		  no longer worked with GNOME >= 2.14 and has been
		  removed: a .desktop file is now installed in the xdg
		  autostart directory instead
		* Since support for non-system sound events has been
		  removed from GNOME 2.14, the
		  mail-notification.soundlist file is no longer
		  installed
		* The mail reader setting has been removed; the mail
		  reader configured in GNOME (Desktop -> Preferences
		  -> Preferred Applications) will now be used
		* The tooltip width is now limited to the screen width
		* When coupled with a patched GNOME Panel (as shipped
		  by FreeBSD and Debian, for instance), the status
		  icon now supports panel transparency (patch
		  forwarded by Bernat Tallaferro)

	* mbox, Maildir, POP3, IMAP, Evolution and Sylpheed changes:
		* Messages are now classified as unseen and seen; seen
		  messages can be ignored by unchecking the "Display
		  seen mail" option

	* mbox changes:
		* Compressed mailboxes (gzip and bzip2) are now
		  handled transparently, and support immediate
		  notification

	* POP3, IMAP and Gmail changes:
		* A regression which allowed mail checks to overlap
		  has been fixed

	* POP3 and IMAP changes:
		* If the server advertises the STLS/STARTTLS
		  capability but replies ERR/BAD when the
		  STLS/STARTTLS command is issued, Mail Notification
		  now logs out instead of proceeding
		* If multiple mailboxes have the same type, hostname,
		  port, connection type and username, Mail
		  Notification will now detect that the mailboxes
		  share the same account and will only prompt for the
		  password once per session (when the password is not
		  entered in the properties dialog, that is)

	* POP3 changes:
		* Non-UTF-8 server responses are now accepted

	* IMAP changes:
		* Non-ASCII server responses are now accepted (these
		  responses violate RFC 3501, but we follow the RFC
		  793 robustness principle "be liberal in what you
		  accept"); fixes connection problems with
		  internationalized Exchange servers, which violate
		  RFC 3501 by sending non-ASCII characters in their
		  greeting message
		* Empty continuation responses are now allowed (fixes
		  authentication with some SASL mechanisms)
		* Play nice with uncompliant servers by using
		  BODY.PEEK rather than BODY, so that they do not set
		  the \Seen flag (patch from Jacob Berkman)
		* The IDLE mode is now cycled every 29 minutes, as
		  advised by RFC 2177

	* Evolution changes:
		* Support for the Evolution 2.4 and 2.6 branches has
		  been added; untested support for the Evolution
		  2.7/2.8 branch has been added; the Evolution source
		  tree is no longer needed for Evolution >= 2.4

	* Sylpheed changes:
		* With the help of a Sylpheed patch, Mail Notification
		  can now reliably avoid race conditions which could
		  occur when Sylpheed was running (see the
		  --enable-sylpheed-locking discussion in the INSTALL
		  file)

	* Updated translations:
		* French

	* New translations:
		* Czech (Pav Lucistnik)
		* Brazilian Portuguese (Claudio André)
		* Dutch (Marcel J. Zwiebel)
		* Japanese (Hiroshi Hasebe)

2.0					August 9, 2005

	* Core changes:
		* Evolution support has been added
		* Mailboxes can now be assigned a custom name
		* For greater flexibility, mailboxes configuration is
		  now stored in ~/.gnome2/mail-notification/mailboxes.xml
		  (previously, it was stored in the GConf database)
		* The mailbox list widget has been redesigned
		* The mailbox properties dialog has been redesigned
		* Copying a mailbox to the clipboard does not make it
		  available to Nautilus anymore: that behaviour was
		  confusing and useless. However, pasting files copied
		  from Nautilus still works.
		* If a mailbox requires authentication and the
		  necessary credentials are not provided in the
		  mailbox properties dialog, Mail Notification now
		  lets GNOME prompt the user for the credentials
		* A test popup can now be displayed from the Mail
		  Summary Popup properties tab
		* The --report command line option has been removed
		* The Mail Notification item is now also listed in the
		  GNOME >= 2.10 Preferences menu
		* The welcome dialog has been removed
		* A few icons have been modified
		* The third-party libegg code has been updated
		* Now requires GTK+ version 2.6.0 or superior
		* Minor fixes and cleanups

	* mbox, MH, Maildir and Sylpheed changes:
		* Immediate notification did not work properly with
		  fast kernel notifiers (kqueue, inotify, dnotify,
		  ...): fixed
		* Unseekable files are now supported
		* Mailbox type changes are now detected and handled
		  (previously, Mail Notification had to be restarted
		  if a mailbox changed type)
		* The location of the system mailbox is now resolved
		  at runtime rather than when the mailbox is added
		  (eases sharing the Mail Notification settings across
		  multiple computers)

	* mbox changes:
		* When immediate notification is not available, the
		  mailbox is now also checked when its size or ctime
		  changes (previously, it was only checked if its
		  mtime had changed)

	* Sylpheed changes:
		* Mail Notification now tries to avoid race conditions
		  which may occur while Sylpheed is being used
		* Mark file errors are not ignored anymore
		* A memory leak has been fixed

	* POP3, IMAP and Gmail changes:
		* The username can now also be left out, and will be
		  prompted when needed

	* POP3 and IMAP changes:
		* Non-UTF-8 characters are now escaped from
		  uncompliant server responses before being displayed
		  in the user interface
		* If the system resolver is not reentrant,
		  getaddrinfo()/getnameinfo() calls are now serialized
		* The Cyrus SASL library is now initialized only once,
		  since multiple sasl_client_init()/sasl_done()
		  invocations may cause problems (another benefit is
		  that it allows the SASL library to use the POP3
		  initial client response feature, which saves a
		  roundtrip during the SASL authentication exchange)
		* When the authentication mechanism option is set to
		  "autodetect", Mail Notification will now try to
		  authenticate using each server-supported SASL
		  mechanism
		* Mail Notification was incorrectly disallowing empty
		  SASL server challenges, although they are legit:
		  fixed

	* POP3 changes:
		* The TOP optional command is now supported. This
		  solves some issues with POP3 servers (for instance,
		  pop.gmail.com) which incorrectly archive mails that
		  have been accessed using the RETR command.
		* Initial SASL client responses are now handled
		  properly (passed as an argument to the AUTH command
		  rather than in the SASL authentication exchange)

	* IMAP changes:
		* If, while idling, the server abruptly drops the
		  connection, Mail Notification now reconnects rather
		  than considering it an error
		* When idling, Mail Notification now only wakes up if
		  it receives a response indicating that the mailbox
		  might have changed
		* By default, Mail Notification now avoids using the
		  IDLE extension if the remote server software is
		  known to have a broken IDLE implementation
		* UTF-8 mailbox names are now converted to modified
		  UTF-7, as required by RFC 3501

	* Gmail changes:
		* Functionality has been restored after the Gmail web
		  site was modified; to prevent future disruptions and
		  simplify the source code, the Gmail Atom feed
		  (https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom) is now used
		* Now works even if the Gmail account language is not
		  set to English
		* libsoup and ICU are no longer required

	* Updated translations:
		* French
		* Serbian (Filip Miletic)
		* German (Hendrik Brandt, Jens Seidel)

1.1					March 6, 2005

	* IMAP changes:
		* is more tolerant towards uncompliant FETCH responses
		* ignores case of responses (RFC 3501)
		* makes sure the server responses are valid ASCII (RFC
		  3501)

	* Gmail changes:
		* properly converts timestamps (requires ICU)
		* handles timestamps from previous years
		* displays all the messages of a conversation

	* POP3 and IMAP changes:
		* does not loop infinitely when no password is
		  specified, an authentication mechanism is specified
		  and authentication fails
		* does not abort when a SASL authentication mechanism
		  is specified and the server does not support any
		  SASL authentication mechanism

	* POP3 and Gmail changes:
		* makes sure the server responses are valid UTF-8

	* The mail summary dialog has been replaced by a main window,
	  for controlling Mail Notification when the status icon is
	  hidden
	* Added "update the mail status" double-click action
	* The tooltip mailbox lists (Mailboxes Having New Mail,
	  Errors, Unsupported Mailboxes) are now sorted
	* GMime is now mandatory for mbox, MH, Maildir, Sylpheed, POP3
	  and IMAP mailbox support
	* The --quit command line argument has been added
	* Minor fixes and cleanups

	* Updated translations:
		* Polish (Maurycy Pawłowski-Wieroński)
		* Serbian (Filip Miletic)
		* Portuguese (Duarte Henriques)
		* German (Hendrik Brandt)

1.0					November 25, 2004

	* Some minor IMAP issues have been fixed
	* Some IMAP servers did not properly support the IDLE
	  extension, so it can now be disabled in the mailbox
	  properties
	* If the POP3 or IMAP password is left blank, it will now be
	  prompted only if needed
	* When MIME support was disabled, the Sylpheed backend was not
	  considering unread messages as new: fixed

	* Updated translations:
		* Serbian (Filip Miletic)
		* German (Hendrik Brandt)
		* Portuguese (Duarte Henriques)

	* New translations:
		* Polish (Tomasz Sarota-Raczek)

0.99					November 15, 2004

	* The IMAP capabilities sent in a PREAUTH, AUTHENTICATE or
	  LOGIN response were ignored, and a CAPABILITY command was
	  not re-issued after a successful authentication: fixed
	* Added a "Display mail summary in tooltip" option

0.8.1					November 4, 2004

	* Mail summary popup changes:
		* do not recreate it when updating its contents:
		  removes some flicker
		* added a workaround for a Metacity bug which
		  sometimes misplaced the popup
		* the text fonts can now be configured from the
		  properties dialog

	* Now compiles cleanly even when -fstrict-aliasing is in use
	* Some additional workarounds for
	  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64764 have been
	  added: fixes a few random crashes
	* Some widgets have been named, so that they can easily be
	  matched in a GTK+ resource file
	* The status icon could not be customized from a resource
	  file: fixed

	* Updated translations:
		* Serbian (Filip Miletic)

0.8.0					October 31, 2004

	* The double-click action can now be customized

	* Gmail changes:
		* does not crash when a GNOME proxy is set
		* handles starred and labelled messages
		* ignores non-inbox messages
		* messages were considered unseen on each check and

	  case, it will be prompted when needed and not be saved to
	  permanent storage)
	* A command can now be executed when all mail has been read
	* The user interface now displays the IMAP folder name (unless
	  it is inbox)
	* The tooltip now displays message counts

	* Updated translations:
		* Serbian (Filip Miletic)
		* German (Hendrik Brandt)
		* Portuguese (Duarte Henriques)

0.7.0					October 6, 2004

	* Binaries compiled with GCC 3.4.x were crashing in various
	  places: fixed
